<p>Certificates in the Web&#8217;s X.509 PKI (PKIX) are used for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.

Today, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.

  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Certificates in the Web PKI are most commonly used to authenticate domain names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Existing Web PKI certificate authorities tend to run on a set of ad hoc protocols for certificate issuance and identity verification.  A typical user experience is something like:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Generate a PKCS#10 <a href="#RFC2314">[RFC2314]</a> Certificate Signing Request (CSR).</li>
  <li>Cut-and-paste the CSR into a CA web page.</li>
  <li>Prove ownership of the domain by one of the following methods: <ul><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a specific place on the web server.</li><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a DNS location corresponding to the target domain.</li><li>Receive CA challenge at a (hopefully) administrator-controlled e-mail address corresponding to the domain and then respond to it on the CA&#8217;s web page.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Download the issued certificate and install it on their Web Server.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">With the exception of the CSR itself and the certificates that are issued, these are all completely ad hoc procedures and are accomplished by getting the human user to follow interactive natural-language instructions from the CA rather than by machine-implemented published protocols.  In many cases, the instructions are difficult to follow and cause significant confusion.  Informal usability tests by the authors indicate that webmasters often need 1-3 hours to obtain and install a certificate for a domain.  Even in the best case, the lack of published, standardized mechanisms presents an obstacle to the wide deployment of HTTPS and other PKIX-dependent systems because it inhibits mechanization of tasks related to certificate issuance, deployment, and revocation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document describes an extensible framework for automating the issuance and domain validation procedure, thereby allowing servers and infrastructural software to obtain certificates without user interaction.  Use of this protocol should radically simplify the deployment of HTTPS and the practicality of PKIX authentication for other protocols based on TLS <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#deployment-model-and-operator-experience" id="deployment-model-and-operator-experience">Deployment Model and Operator Experience</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The major guiding use case for ACME is obtaining certificates for Web sites (HTTPS <a href="#RFC2818">[RFC2818]</a>).  In that case, the server is intended to speak for one or more domains, and the process of certificate issuance is intended to verify that the server actually speaks for the domain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA verification of information about the certificate subject.  &#8220;Domain Validation&#8221; (DV) certificates are by far the most common type.  For DV validation, the CA merely verifies that the requester has effective control of the web server and/or DNS server for the domain, but does not explicitly attempt to verify their real-world identity.  (This is as opposed to &#8220;Organization Validation&#8221; (OV) and &#8220;Extended Validation&#8221; (EV) certificates, where the process is intended to also verify the real-world identity of the requester.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">DV certificate validation commonly checks claims about properties related to control of a domain name &#8211; properties that can be observed by the issuing authority in an interactive process that can be conducted purely online.  That means that under typical circumstances, all steps in the request, verification, and issuance process can be represented and performed by Internet protocols with no out-of-band human intervention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">When an operator deploys a current HTTPS server, it generally prompts him to generate a self-signed certificate.  When an operator deploys an ACME-compatible web server, the experience would be something like this:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The ACME client prompts the operator for the intended domain name(s) that the web server is to stand for.</li>
  <li>The ACME client presents the operator with a list of CAs from which it could get a certificate.  (This list will change over time based on the capabilities of CAs and updates to ACME configuration.) The ACME client might prompt the operator for payment information at this point.</li>
  <li>The operator selects a CA.</li>
  <li>In the background, the ACME client contacts the CA and requests that a certificate be issued for the intended domain name(s).</li>
  <li>Once the CA is satisfied, the certificate is issued and the ACME client automatically downloads and installs it, potentially notifying the operator via e-mail, SMS, etc.</li>
  <li>The ACME client periodically contacts the CA to get updated certificates, stapled OCSP responses, or whatever else would be required to keep the server functional and its credentials up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The overall idea is that it&#8217;s nearly as easy to deploy with a CA-issued certificate as a self-signed certificate, and that once the operator has done so, the process is self-sustaining with minimal manual intervention.  Close integration of ACME with HTTPS servers, for example, can allow the immediate and automated deployment of certificates as they are issued, optionally sparing the human administrator from additional configuration work.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The key words &#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;REQUIRED&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL NOT&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD NOT&#8221;, &#8220;RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;MAY&#8221;, and &#8220;OPTIONAL&#8221; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The two main roles in ACME are &#8220;client&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221;.  The ACME client uses the protocol to request certificate management actions, such as issuance or revocation.  An ACME client therefore typically runs on a web server, mail server, or some other server system which requires valid TLS certificates.  The ACME server runs at a certificate authority, and responds to client requests, performing the requested actions if the client is authorized.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">For simplicity, in all HTTPS transactions used by ACME, the ACME client is the HTTPS client and the ACME server is the HTTPS server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">In the discussion below, we will refer to three different types of keys / key pairs:</p>
<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>Subject Public Key:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A public key to be included in a certificate.</dd>
  <dt>Account Key Pair:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A key pair for which the ACME server considers the holder of the private key authorized to manage certificates for a given identifier.  The same key pair may be authorized for multiple identifiers.</dd>
  <dt>Recovery Key:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">A MAC key that a client can use to demonstrate that it participated in a prior registration transaction.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">ACME messaging is based on HTTPS <a href="#RFC2818">[RFC2818]</a> and JSON <a href="#RFC7159">[RFC7159]</a>.  Since JSON is a text-based format, binary fields are Base64-encoded.  For Base64 encoding, we use the variant defined in <a href="#RFC7515">[RFC7515]</a>.  The important features of this encoding are (1) that it uses the URL-safe character set, and (2) that &#8220;=&#8221; padding characters are stripped.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">Some HTTPS bodies in ACME are authenticated and integrity-protected by being encapsulated in a JSON Web Signature (JWS) object <a href="#RFC7515">[RFC7515]</a>.  ACME uses a profile of JWS, with the following restrictions:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The JWS MUST use the Flattened JSON Serialization</li>
  <li>The JWS MUST be encoded using UTF-8</li>
  <li>The JWS Header or Protected Header MUST include &#8220;alg&#8221; and &#8220;jwk&#8221; fields</li>
  <li>The JWS MUST NOT have the value &#8220;none&#8221; in its &#8220;alg&#8221; field</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.9">Additionally, JWS objects used in ACME MUST include the &#8220;nonce&#8221; header parameter, defined below.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#protocol-overview" id="protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">ACME allows a client to request certificate management actions using a set of JSON messages carried over HTTPS.   In some ways, ACME functions much like a traditional CA, in which a user creates an account, adds identifiers to that account (proving control of the domains), and requests certificate issuance for those domains while logged in to the account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">In ACME, the account is represented by an account key pair.  The &#8220;add a domain&#8221; function is accomplished by authorizing the key pair for a given domain.  Certificate issuance and revocation are authorized by a signature with the key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The first phase of ACME is for the client to register with the ACME server.  The client generates an asymmetric key pair and associates this key pair with a set of contact information by signing the contact information.  The server acknowledges the registration by replying with a registration object echoing the client&#8217;s input.</p>
<pre>
      Client                                                  Server

      Contact Information
      Signature                     -------&gt;

                                    &lt;-------            Registration
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">Before a client can issue certificates, it must establish an authorization with the server for an account key pair to act for the identifier(s) that it wishes to include in the certificate.  To do this, the client must demonstrate to the server both (1) that it holds the private key of the account key pair, and (2) that it has authority over the identifier being claimed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Proof of possession of the account key is built into the ACME protocol.  All messages from the client to the server are signed by the client, and the server verifies them using the public key of the account key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">To verify that the client controls the identifier being claimed, the server issues the client a set of challenges.  Because there are many different ways to validate possession of different types of identifiers, the server will choose from an extensible set of challenges that are appropriate for the identifier being claimed.  The client responds with a set of responses that tell the server which challenges the client has completed.  The server then validates the challenges to check that the client has accomplished the challenge.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">For example, if the client requests a domain name, the server might challenge the client to provision a record in the DNS under that name, or to provision a file on a web server referenced by an A or AAAA record under that name.  The server would then query the DNS for the record in question, or send an HTTP request for the file.  If the client provisioned the DNS or the web server as expected, then the server considers the client authorized for the domain name.</p>

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">Once the client has authorized an account key pair for an identifier, it can use the key pair to authorize the issuance of certificates for the identifier.  To do this, the client sends a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the server (indicating the identifier(s) to be included in the issued certificate) and a signature over the CSR by the private key of the account key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.9">If the server agrees to issue the certificate, then it creates the certificate and provides it in its response.  The certificate is assigned a URI, which the client can use to fetch updated versions of the certificate.</p>
<pre>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.11">Note that while ACME is defined with enough flexibility to handle different types of identifiers in principle, the primary use case addressed by this document is the case where domain names are used as identifiers.  For example, all of the identifier validation challenges described in <a href="#identifier-validation-challenges">Section 7</a> below address validation of domain names.  The use of ACME for other protocols will require further specification, in order to describe how these identifiers are encoded in the protocol, and what types of validation challenges the server might require.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">In order to protect ACME resources from any possible replay attacks, ACME requests have a mandatory anti-replay mechanism.  This mechanism is based on the server maintaining a list of nonces that it has issued to clients, and requiring any signed request from the client to carry such a nonce.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">An ACME server MUST include a Replay-Nonce header field in each successful response it provides to a client, with contents as specified below.  In particular, the ACME server MUST provide a Replay-Nonce header field in response to a HEAD request for any valid resource.  (This allows clients to easily obtain a fresh nonce.)  It MAY also provide nonces in error responses.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.3">Every JWS sent by an ACME client MUST include, in its protected header, the &#8220;nonce&#8221; header parameter, with contents as defined below.  As part of JWS verification, the ACME server MUST verify that the value of the &#8220;nonce&#8221; header is a value that the server previously provided in a Replay-Nonce header field.  Once a nonce value has appeared in an ACME request, the server MUST consider it invalid, in the same way as a value it had never issued.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.4">When a server rejects a request because its nonce value was unacceptable (or not present), it SHOULD provide HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request), and indicate the ACME error code &#8220;urn:acme:badNonce&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.5">The precise method used to generate and track nonces is up to the server.  For example, the server could generate a random 128-bit value for each response, keep a list of issued nonces, and strike nonces from this list as they are used.</p>

The server should generate the value provided in Replay-Nonce in such a way that they are unique to each message, with high probability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.1.p.2">The value of the Replay-Nonce field MUST be an octet string encoded according to the base64url encoding described in Section 2 of <a href="#RFC7515">[RFC7515]</a>.  Clients MUST ignore invalid Replay-Nonce values.</p>

<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Registration resources, representing information about an account</li>
  <li>Authorization resources, representing an account&#8217;s authorization to act for an identifier</li>
  <li>Challenge resources, representing a challenge to prove control of an identifier</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">For the &#8220;new-X&#8221; resources above, the server MUST have exactly one resource for each function.  This resource may be addressed by multiple URIs, but all must provide equivalent functionality.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">In general, the intent is for authorization and certificate resources to contain only public information, so that CAs may publish these resources to document what certificates have been issued and how they were authorized.  Non-public information, such as contact information, is stored in registration resources.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.5">ACME uses different URIs for different management functions. Each function is listed in a directory along with its corresponding URI, so clients only need to be configured with the directory URI.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.6">The &#8220;up&#8221; link relation is used with challenge resources to indicate the authorization resource to which a challenge belongs.

<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.2">By &#8220;recovery&#8221;, we mean that the information associated with an old account key is bound to a new account key.  When a recovery process succeeds, the server provides the client with a new registration whose contents are the same as base registration object &#8211; except for the &#8220;key&#8221; field, which is set to the new account key.  The server reassigns resources associated with the base registration to the new registration (e.g., authorizations and certificates).  The server SHOULD delete the old registration resource after it has been used as a base for recovery.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.3">In addition to the recovery mechanisms defined by ACME, individual client implementations may also offer implementation-specific recovery mechanisms.  For example, if a client creates account keys deterministically from a seed value, then this seed could be used to recover the account key by re-generating it.

<p id="rfc.section.6.4.2.p.1">In the contact-based recovery process, the client requests that the server send a message to one of the contact URIs registered for the account.  That message indicates some action that the server requires the client&#8217;s user to perform, e.g., clicking a link in an email.  If the user successfully completes the server&#8217;s required actions, then the server will bind the account to the new account key.</p>

If the recovery process is still pending, the server sends a 202 (Accepted) status code, and a Retry-After header field. If the recovery process has failed, the server sends an error code (e.g., 404), and SHOULD delete the stub registration resource.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.2.p.7">If the recovery process has succeeded, then the server will send a 200 (OK) response, containing the full registration object, with any necessary information copied from the old registration).

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">The identifier authorization process establishes the authorization of an account to manage certificates for a given identifier.  This process must assure the server of two things: First, that the client controls the private key of the account key pair, and second, that the client holds the identifier in question.  This process may be repeated to associate multiple identifiers to a key pair (e.g., to request certificates with multiple identifiers), or to associate multiple accounts with an identifier (e.g., to allow multiple entities to manage certificates).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">As illustrated by the figure in the overview section above, the authorization process proceeds in two phases.  The client first requests a new authorization, and the server issues challenges, then the client responds to those challenges and the server validates the client&#8217;s responses.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.3">To begin the key authorization process, the client sends a POST request to the server&#8217;s new-authorization resource.  The body of the POST request MUST contain a JWS object, whose payload is a partial authorization object.  This JWS object MUST contain only the &#8220;identifier&#8221; field, so that the server knows what identifier is being authorized.  The server MUST ignore any other fields present in the client&#8217;s request object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.4">The authorization object is implicitly tied to the account key used to sign the request. Once created, the authorization may only be updated by that account.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.5">Before processing the authorization further, the server SHOULD determine whether it is willing to issue certificates for the identifier.  For example, the server should check that the identifier is of a supported type.  Servers might also check names against a blacklist of known high-value identifiers.  If the server is unwilling to issue for the identifier, it SHOULD return a 403 (Forbidden) error, with a problem document describing the reason for the rejection.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.9">The client needs to respond with information to complete the challenges.  To do this, the client updates the authorization object received from the server by filling in any required information in the elements of the &#8220;challenges&#8221; dictionary.  (This is also the stage where the client should perform any actions required by the challenge.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.10">The client sends these updates back to the server in the form of a JSON object with the response fields required by the challenge type, carried in a POST request to the challenge URI (not authorization URI or the new-authorization URI).  This allows the client to send information only for challenges it is responding to.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.11">For example, if the client were to respond to the &#8220;simpleHttp&#8221; challenge in the above authorization, it would send the following request:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.12">The server updates the authorization document by updating its representation of the challenge with the response fields provided by the client.  The server MUST ignore any fields in the response object that are not specified as response fields for this type of challenge.  The server provides a 200 (OK) response with the updated challenge object as its body.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.13">Presumably, the client&#8217;s responses provide the server with enough information to validate one or more challenges.  The server is said to &#8220;finalize&#8221; the authorization when it has completed all the validations it is going to complete, and assigns the authorization a status of &#8220;valid&#8221; or &#8220;invalid&#8221;, corresponding to whether it considers the account authorized for the identifier.  If the final state is &#8220;valid&#8221;, the server MUST add an &#8220;expires&#8221; field to the authorization.  When finalizing an authorization, the server MAY remove the &#8220;combinations&#8221; field (if present) or remove any challenges still pending.  The server SHOULD NOT remove challenges with status &#8220;invalid&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.14">Usually, the validation process will take some time, so the client will need to poll the authorization resource to see when it is finalized.  For challenges where the client can tell when the server has validated the challenge (e.g., by seeing an HTTP or DNS request from the server), the client SHOULD NOT begin polling until it has seen the validation request from the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.15">To check on the status of an authorization, the client sends a GET request to the authorization URI, and the server responds with the current  authorization object. In responding to poll requests while the validation is still in progress, the server MUST return a 202 (Accepted) response with a Retry-After header field.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.4">The values provided in the CSR are only a request, and are not guaranteed.  The server or CA may alter any fields in the certificate before issuance.  For example, the CA may remove identifiers that are not authorized for the account key that signed the request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.5">It is up to the server&#8217;s local policy to decide which names are acceptable in a certificate, given the authorizations that the server associates with the client&#8217;s account key.  A server MAY consider a client authorized for a wildcard domain if it is authorized for the underlying domain name (without the &#8220;*&#8221; label).  Servers SHOULD NOT extend authorization across identifier types.  For example, if a client is authorized for &#8220;example.com&#8221;, then the server should not allow the client to issue a certificate with an iPAddress subjectAltName, even if it contains an IP address to which example.com resolves.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.12">To avoid unnecessary renewals, the CA may choose not to issue a renewed certificate until it receives such a request (if it even allows renewal at all).  In such cases, if the CA requires some time to generate the new certificate, the CA MUST return a 202 (Accepted) response, with a Retry-After header field that indicates when the new certificate will be available.

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">There are few types of identifier in the world for which there is a standardized mechanism to prove possession of a given identifier.  In all practical cases, CAs rely on a variety of means to test whether an entity applying for a certificate with a given identifier actually controls that identifier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Challenges provide the server with assurance that an account key holder is also the entity that controls an identifier.  For each type of challenge, it must be the case that in order for an entity to successfully complete the challenge the entity must both:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Hold the private key of the account key pair used to respond to the challenge</li>
  <li>Control the identifier in question</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#security-considerations">Section 9</a> documents how the challenges defined in this document meet these requirements.  New challenges will need to document how they do.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">To accommodate this reality, ACME includes an extensible challenge/response framework for identifier validation.  This section describes an initial set of Challenge types.  Each challenge must describe:</p>
<p/>

  <li>Content of Challenge payloads (in Challenge messages)</li>
  <li>Content of Response payloads (in authorizationRequest messages)</li>
  <li>How the server uses the Challenge and Response to verify control of an identifier</li>

If this field is missing, then the default value is &#8220;pending&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.10">validated (optional, string): : The time at which this challenge was completed by the server, encoded in the format specified in RFC 3339 <a href="#RFC3339">[RFC3339]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.11">error (optional, dictionary of string): : The error that occurred while the server was validating the challenge, if any.  This field is structured as a problem document <a href="#I-D.ietf-appsawg-http-problem">[I-D.ietf-appsawg-http-problem]</a>.</p>

If the server sets a Challenge&#8217;s &#8220;status&#8221; to &#8220;invalid&#8221;, it SHOULD also include the &#8220;error&#8221; field to help the client diagnose why they failed the challenge.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.13">Different challenges allow the server to obtain proof of different aspects of control over an identifier.  In some challenges, like Simple HTTP and DVSNI, the client directly proves its ability to do certain things related to the identifier.  In the Proof of Possession challenge, the client proves historical control of the identifier, by reference to a prior authorization transaction or certificate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.14">The choice of which Challenges to offer to a client under which circumstances is a matter of server policy.  A CA may choose different sets of challenges depending on whether it has interacted with a domain before, and how.  For example:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>New domain with no known certificates: Domain Validation (DVSNI or Simple HTTP)</li>
  <li>Domain for which known certs exist from other CAs: DV + Proof of Possession of previous CA-signed key</li>
  <li>Domain with a cert from this CA, lost account key: DV + PoP of ACME-certified Subject key</li>
  <li>Domain with a cert from this CA, all keys and recovery mechanisms lost: Out of band proof of authority for the domain</li>

<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">The Proof of Possession challenge verifies that a client possesses a private key corresponding to a server-specified public key, as demonstrated by its ability to sign with that key.  This challenge is meant to be used when the server knows of a public key that is already associated with the identifier being claimed, and wishes for new authorizations to be authorized by the holder of the corresponding private key.  For DNS identifiers, for example, this can help guard against domain hijacking.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">This method is useful if a server policy calls for issuing a certificate only to an entity that already possesses the subject private key of a particular prior related certificate (perhaps issued by a different CA).

<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.3">This challenge proceeds in much the same way as the proof of possession of the authorized key pair in the main ACME flow (challenge + authorizationRequest).  The server provides a nonce and the client signs over the nonce.  The main difference is that rather than signing with the private key of the key pair being authorized, the client signs with a private key specified by the server.  The server can specify which key pair(s) are acceptable directly (by indicating a public key), or by asking for the key corresponding to a certificate.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">ACME is a protocol for managing certificates that attest to identifier/key bindings.  Thus the foremost security goal of ACME is to ensure the integrity of this process, i.e., to ensure that the bindings attested by certificates are correct, and that only authorized entities can manage certificates.  ACME identifies clients by their account keys, so this overall goal breaks down into two more precise goals:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Only an entity that controls a identifier can get an account key authorized for that identifier</li>
  <li>Once authorized, an account key&#8217;s authorizations cannot be improperly transferred to another account key</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">In this section, we discuss the threat model that underlies ACME and the ways that ACME achieves these security goals within that threat model.  We also discuss the denial-of-service risks that ACME servers face, and a few other miscellaneous considerations.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.1"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1">9.1.</a> <a href="#threat-model" id="threat-model">Threat model</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">As a service on the Internet, ACME broadly exists within the Internet threat model <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a>.  In analyzing ACME, it is useful to think of an ACME server interacting with other Internet hosts along three &#8220;channels&#8221;:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>An ACME channel, over which the ACME HTTPS requests are exchanged</li>
  <li>A validation channel, over which the ACME server performs additional requests to validate a client&#8217;s control of an identifier</li>
  <li>A contact channel, over which the ACME server sends messages to the registered contacts for ACME clients</li>
</ul>
<pre>
+------------+
|    ACME    |     ACME Channel
|   Client   |--------------------+
+------------+                    |
       ^                          V
       |   Contact Channel  +------------+
       +--------------------|    ACME    |
                            |   Server   |

| Validation |&lt;-------------------+
|   Server   |  Validation Channel
+------------+
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.3">In practice, the risks to these channels are not entirely separate, but they are different in most cases.  Each of the three channels, for example, uses a different communications pattern: the ACME channel will comprise inbound HTTPS connections to the ACME server, the validation channel outbound HTTP or DNS requests, and the contact channel will use channels such as email and PSTN.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.4">Broadly speaking, ACME aims to be secure against active and passive attackers on any individual channel.  Some vulnerabilities arise (noted below), when an attacker can exploit both the ACME channel and one of the others.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.5">On the ACME channel, in addition to network-layer attackers, we also need to account for application-layer man in the middle attacks, and for abusive use of the protocol itself.  Protection against application-layer MitM addresses potential attackers such as Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and middleboxes with a TLS MitM function.  Preventing abusive use of ACME means ensuring that an attacker with access to the validation or contact channels can&#8217;t obtain illegitimate authorization by acting as an ACME client (legitimately, in terms of the protocol).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.2"><a href="#rfc.section.9.2">9.2.</a> <a href="#integrity-of-authorizations" id="integrity-of-authorizations">Integrity of Authorizations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">ACME allows anyone to request challenges for an identifier by registering an account key and sending a new-authorization request under that account key.  The integrity of the authorization process thus depends on the identifier validation challenges to ensure that the challenge can only be completed by someone who both (1) holds the private key of the account key pair, and (2) controls the identifier in question.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.2">Validation responses need to be bound to an account key pair in order to avoid situations where an ACME MitM can switch out a legitimate domain holder&#8217;s account key for one of his choosing, e.g.:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Legitimate domain holder registers account key pair A</li>
  <li>MitM registers account key pair B</li>
  <li>Legitimate domain holder sends a new-authorization request signed under account key A</li>
  <li>MitM suppresses the legitimate request, but sends the same request signed under account key B</li>
  <li>ACME server issues challenges and MitM forwards them to the legitimate domain holder</li>
  <li>Legitimate domain holder provisions the validation response</li>
  <li>ACME server performs validation query and sees the response provisioned by the legitimate domain holder</li>
  <li>Because the challenges were issued in response to a message signed account key B, the ACME server grants authorization to account key B (the MitM) instead of account key A (the legitimate domain holder)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.4">All of the challenges above that require an out-of-band query by the server have a binding to the account private key, such that the only the account private key holder can successfully respond to the validation query:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Simple HTTP: The value provided in the validation request is signed by the account private key.</li>
  <li>DVSNI: The validation TLS request uses the account key pair as the server&#8217;s key pair.</li>
  <li>DNS: The MAC covers the account key, and the MAC key is derived from an ECDH public key signed with the account private key.</li>
  <li>Proof of possession of a prior key: The signature by the prior key covers the account public key.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.6">The association of challenges to identifiers is typically done by requiring the client to perform some action that only someone who effectively controls the identifier can perform.  For the challenges in this document, the actions are:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Simple HTTP: Provision files under .well-known on a web server for the domain</li>
  <li>DVSNI: Configure a TLS server for the domain</li>
  <li>DNS: Provision DNS resource records for the domain</li>
  <li>Proof of possession of a prior key: Sign using the private key specified by the server</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.8">There are several ways that these assumptions can be violated, both by misconfiguration and by attack.  For example, on a web server that allows non-administrative users to write to .well-known, any user can claim to own the server&#8217;s hostname by responding to a Simple HTTP challenge, and likewise for TLS configuration and DVSNI.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.9">The use of hosting providers is a particular risk for ACME validation.  If the owner of the domain has outsourced operation of DNS or web services to a hosting provider, there is nothing that can be done against tampering by the hosting provider.  As far as the outside world is concerned, the zone or web site provided by the hosting provider is the real thing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.10">More limited forms of delegation can also lead to an unintended party gaining the ability to successfully complete a validation transaction.  For example, suppose an ACME server follows HTTP redirects in Simple HTTP validation and a web site operator provisions a catch-all redirect rule that redirects requests for unknown resources to different domain.  Then the target of the redirect could use that to get a certificate through Simple HTTP validation, since the validation path will not be known to the primary server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.11">The DNS is a common point of vulnerability for all of these challenges.  An entity that can provision false DNS records for a domain can attack the DNS challenge directly, and can provision false A/AAAA records to direct the ACME server to send its DVSNI or Simple HTTP validation query to a server of the attacker&#8217;s choosing.  There are a few different mitigations that ACME servers can apply:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Checking the DNSSEC status of DNS records used in ACME validation (for zones that are DNSSEC-enabled)</li>
  <li>Querying the DNS from multiple vantage points to address local attackers</li>
  <li>Applying mitigations against DNS off-path attackers, e.g., adding entropy to requests <a href="#I-D.vixie-dnsext-dns0x20">[I-D.vixie-dnsext-dns0x20]</a> or only using TCP</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.13">Given these considerations, the ACME validation process makes it impossible for any attacker on the ACME channel, or a passive attacker on the validation channel to hijack the authorization process to authorize a key of the attacker&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.14">An attacker that can only see the ACME channel would need to convince the validation server to provide a response that would authorize the attacker&#8217;s account key, but this is prevented by binding the validation response to the account key used to request challenges.  A passive attacker on the validation channel can observe the correct validation response and even replay it, but that response can only be used with the account key for which it was generated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.15">An active attacker on the validation channel can subvert the ACME process, by performing normal ACME transactions and providing a validation response for his own account key.  The risks due to hosting providers noted above are a particular case.  For identifiers where the server already has some credential associated with the domain this attack can be prevented by requiring the client to complete a proof-of-possession challenge.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.3"><a href="#rfc.section.9.3">9.3.</a> <a href="#preventing-authorization-hijacking" id="preventing-authorization-hijacking">Preventing Authorization Hijacking</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">The account recovery processes described in <a href="#account-recovery">Section 6.4</a> allow authorization to be transferred from one account key to another, in case the former account key pair&#8217;s private key is lost.  ACME needs to prevent these processes from being exploited by an attacker to hijack the authorizations attached to one key and assign them to a key of the attacker&#8217;s choosing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">Recovery takes place in two steps: 1. Provisioning recovery information (contact or recovery key) 2. Using recovery information to recover an account</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">The provisioning process needs to ensure that only the account key holder ends up with information that is useful for recovery.  The recovery process needs to assure that only the (now former) account key holder can successfully execute recovery, i.e., that this entity is the only one that can choose the new account key that receives the capabilities held by the account being recovered.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.4">MAC-based recovery can be performed if the attacker knows the account key and registration URI for the account being recovered.  Both of these are difficult to obtain for a network attacker, because ACME uses HTTPS, though if the recovery key and registration URI are sufficiently predictable, the attacker might be able to guess them.  An ACME MitM can see the registration URI, but still has to guess the recovery key, since neither the ECDH in the provisioning phase nor HMAC in the recovery phase will reveal it to him.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.5">ACME clients can thus mitigate problems with MAC-based recovery by using long recovery keys.  ACME servers should enforce a minimum recovery key length, and impose rate limits on recovery to limit an attacker&#8217;s ability to test different guesses about the recovery key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.6">Contact-based recovery uses both the ACME channel and the contact channel.  The provisioning process is only visible to an ACME MitM, and even then, the MitM can only observe the contact information provided.  If the ACME attacker does not also have access to the contact channel, there is no risk.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.7">The security of the contact-based recovery process is entirely dependent on the security of the contact channel.  The details of this will depend on the specific out-of-band technique used by the server.  For example:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>If the server requires a user to click a link in a message sent to a contact address, then the contact channel will need to ensure that the message is only available to the legitimate owner of the contact address.  Otherwise, a passive attacker could see the link and click it first, or an active attacker could redirect the message.</li>
  <li>If the server requires a user to respond to a message sent to a contact address containing a secret value, then the contact channel will need to ensure that an attacker cannot observe the secret value and spoof a message from the contact address.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.9">In practice, many contact channels that can be used to reach many clients do not provide strong assurances of the types noted above.  In designing and deploying contact-based recovery schemes, ACME servers operators will need to find an appropriate balance between using contact channels that can reach many clients and using contact-based recovery schemes that achieve an appropriate level of risk using those contact channels.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.4"><a href="#rfc.section.9.4">9.4.</a> <a href="#denial-of-service-considerations" id="denial-of-service-considerations">Denial-of-Service Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.1">As a protocol run over HTTPS, standard considerations for TCP-based and HTTP-based DoS mitigation also apply to ACME.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.2">At the application layer, ACME requires the server to perform a few potentially expensive operations.  Identifier validation transactions require the ACME server to make outbound connections to potentially attacker-controlled servers, and certificate issuance can require interactions with cryptographic hardware.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.3">In addition, an attacker can also cause the ACME server to send validation requests to a domain of its choosing by submitting authorization requests for the victim domain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.4.p.4">All of these attacks can be mitigated by the application of appropriate rate limits.  Issues closer to the front end, like POST body validation, can be addressed using HTTP request limiting.  For validation and certificate requests, there are other identifiers on which rate limits can be keyed.  For example, the server might limit the rate at which any individual account key can issue certificates, or the rate at which validation can be requested within a given subtree of the DNS.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.5"><a href="#rfc.section.9.5">9.5.</a> <a href="#ca-policy-considerations" id="ca-policy-considerations">CA Policy Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.1">The controls on issuance enabled by ACME are focused on validating that a certificate applicant controls the identifier he claims.  Before issuing a certificate, however, there are many other checks that a CA might need to perform, for example:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Has the client agreed to a subscriber agreement?</li>
  <li>Is the claimed identifier syntactically valid?</li>
  <li>For domain names: <ul><li>If the leftmost label is a &#8216;*&#8217;, then have the appropriate checks been applied?</li><li>Is the name on the Public Suffix List?</li><li>Is the name a high-value name?</li><li>Is the name a known phishing domain?</li></ul></li>
  <li>Is the key in the CSR sufficiently strong?</li>
  <li>Is the CSR signed with an acceptable algorithm?</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.5.p.3">CAs that use ACME to automate issuance will need to ensure that their servers perform all necessary checks before issuing.</p>
