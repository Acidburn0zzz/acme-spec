  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Certificates in the Web PKI are most commonly used to authenticate domain names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Existing Web PKI certificate authorities tend to run on a set of ad hoc protocols for certificate issuance and identity verification.  A typical user experience is something like:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Generate a PKCS#10 <a href="#RFC2314">[RFC2314]</a> Certificate Signing Request (CSR).</li>
  <li>Cut-and-paste the CSR into a CA web page.</li>
  <li>Prove ownership of the domain by one of the following methods: <ul><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a specific place on the web server.</li><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a DNS location corresponding to the target domain.</li><li>Receive CA challenge at a (hopefully) administrator-controlled e-mail address corresponding to the domain and then respond to it on the CA&#8217;s web page.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Download the issued certificate and install it on their Web Server.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">With the exception of the CSR itself and the certificates that are issued, these are all completely ad hoc procedures and are accomplished by getting the human user to follow interactive natural-language instructions from the CA rather than by machine-implemented published protocols.  In many cases, the instructions are difficult to follow and cause significant confusion.  Informal usability tests by the authors indicate that webmasters often need 1-3 hours to obtain and install a certificate for a domain.  Even in the best case, the lack of published, standardized mechanisms presents an obstacle to the wide deployment of HTTPS and other PKIX-dependent systems because it inhibits mechanization of tasks related to certificate issuance, deployment, and revocation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document describes an extensible framework for automating the issuance and domain validation procedure, thereby allowing servers and infrastructural software to obtain certificates without user interaction.  Use of this protocol should radically simplify the deployment of HTTPS and the practicality of PKIX authentication for other protocols based on TLS <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#deployment-model-and-operator-experience" id="deployment-model-and-operator-experience">Deployment Model and Operator Experience</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The major guiding use case for ACME is obtaining certificates for Web sites (HTTPS <a href="#RFC2818">[RFC2818]</a>).  In that case, the server is intended to speak for one or more domains, and the process of certificate issuance is intended to verify that the server actually speaks for the domain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA verification of information about the certificate subject.  &#8220;Domain Validation&#8221; (DV) certificates are by far the most common type.  For DV validation, the CA merely verifies that the requester has effective control of the web server and/or DNS server for the domain, but does not explicitly attempt to verify their real-world identity.  (This is as opposed to &#8220;Organization Validation&#8221; (OV) and &#8220;Extended Validation&#8221; (EV) certificates, where the process is intended to also verify the real-world identity of the requester.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">DV certificate validation commonly checks claims about properties related to control of a domain name &#8211; properties that can be observed by the issuing authority in an interactive process that can be conducted purely online.  That means that under typical circumstances, all steps in the request, verification, and issuance process can be represented and performed by Internet protocols with no out-of-band human intervention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">When an operator deploys a current HTTPS server, it generally prompts him to generate a self-signed certificate.  When an operator deploys an ACME-compatible web server, the experience would be something like this:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The ACME client prompts the operator for the intended domain name(s) that the web server is to stand for.</li>
  <li>The ACME client presents the operator with a list of CAs from which it could get a certificate.  (This list will change over time based on the capabilities of CAs and updates to ACME configuration.) The ACME client might prompt the operator for payment information at this point.</li>
  <li>The operator selects a CA.</li>
  <li>In the background, the ACME client contacts the CA and requests that a certificate be issued for the intended domain name(s).</li>
  <li>Once the CA is satisfied, the certificate is issued and the ACME client automatically downloads and installs it, potentially notifying the operator via e-mail, SMS, etc.</li>
  <li>The ACME client periodically contacts the CA to get updated certificates, stapled OCSP responses, or whatever else would be required to keep the server functional and its credentials up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The overall idea is that it&#8217;s nearly as easy to deploy with a CA-issued certificate as a self-signed certificate, and that once the operator has done so, the process is self-sustaining with minimal manual intervention.  Close integration of ACME with HTTPS servers, for example, can allow the immediate and automated deployment of certificates as they are issued, optionally sparing the human administrator from additional configuration work.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The two main roles in ACME are &#8220;client&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221;.  The ACME client uses the protocol to request certificate management actions, such as issuance or revocation.  An ACME client therefore typically runs on a web server, mail server, or some other server system which requires valid TLS certificates.  The ACME server runs at a certificate authority, and responds to client requests, performing the requested actions if the client is authorized.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">For simplicity, in the HTTPS transactions used by ACME, the ACME client is the HTTPS client and the ACME server is the HTTPS server.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">ACME messaging is based on HTTPS <a href="#RFC2818">[RFC2818]</a> and JSON <a href="#RFC7159">[RFC7159]</a>.  Since JSON is a text-based format, binary fields are Base64-encoded.  For Base64 encoding, we use the variant defined in <a href="#RFC7515">[RFC7515]</a>.  The important features of this encoding are (1) that it uses the URL-safe character set, and (2) that &#8220;=&#8221; padding characters are stripped.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">Some HTTPS bodies in ACME are authenticated and integrity-protected by being encapsulated in a JSON Web Signature (JWS) object <a href="#RFC7515">[RFC7515]</a>.  ACME uses a profile of JWS, with the following restrictions:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The JWS MUST use the JSON or Flattened JSON Serialization</li>
  <li>If the JWS is in the JSON Serialization, it MUST NOT include more than one signature in the &#8220;signatures&#8221; array</li>
  <li>The JWS Header MUST include &#8220;alg&#8221; and &#8220;jwk&#8221; fields</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">For most communications between the client and the server, we assume the Internet Threat Model <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a>, i.e., an attacker that can completely control messages between client and server. We additionally assume the attacker can read and modify TLS connections between client and server. This allows ACME deployment behind a TLS-terminating CDN, for DDoS prevention and other attack mitigation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">Domain validation requests initiated by the server are more vulnerable than ACME messages between client and server, because they rely on insecure DNS. In particular, such validation requests are vulnerable to the &#8220;on-path&#8221; attacker described in RFC3552 <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a>.  This is the common threat model assumed by most domain-validating certificate authorities today.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#protocol-overview" id="protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">ACME allows a client to request certificate management actions using a set of JSON messages carried over HTTPS.   In some ways, ACME functions much like a traditional CA, in which a user creates an account, adds identifiers to that account (proving control of the domains), and requests certificate issuance for those domains while logged in to the account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">In ACME, the account is represented by an account key pair.  The &#8220;add a domain&#8221; function is accomplished by authorizing the key pair for a given domain.  Certificate issuance and revocation are authorized by a signature with the key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">The first phase of ACME is for the client to register with the ACME server.  The client generates an asymmetric key pair and associates this key pair with a set of contact information by signing the contact information.  The server acknowledges the registration by replying with a recovery token that the client can provide later to associate a new account key pair in the event that the first account key pair is lost.</p>
<pre>
      Client                                                  Server

      Contact Information
      Signature                     -------&gt;

                                    &lt;-------          Recovery Token

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">Before a client can issue certificates, it must establish an authorization with the server for an account key pair to act for the identifier(s) that it wishes to include in the certificate.  To do this, the client must demonstrate to the server both (1) that it holds the private key of the account key pair, and (2) that it has authority over the identifier being claimed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">Proof of possession of the account key is built into the ACME protocol.  All messages from the client to the server are signed by the client, and the server verifies them using the public key of the account key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">To verify that the client controls the identifier being claimed, the server issues the client a set of challenges.  Because there are many different ways to validate possession of different types of identifiers, the server will choose from an extensible set of challenges that are appropriate for the identifier being claimed.  The client responds with a set of responses that tell the server which challenges the client has completed.  The server then validates the challenges to check that the client has accomplished the challenge.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.7">For example, if the client requests a domain name, the server might challenge the client to provision a record in the DNS under that name, or to provision a file on a web server referenced by an A or AAAA record under that name.  The server would then query the DNS for the record in question, or send an HTTP request for the file.  If the client provisioned the DNS or the web server as expected, then the server considers the client authorized for the domain name.</p>

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.8">Once the client has authorized an account key pair for an identifier, it can use the key pair to authorize the issuance of certificates for the identifier.  To do this, the client sends a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the server (indicating the identifier(s) to be included in the issued certificate) and a signature over the CSR by the private key of the account key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.9">If the server agrees to issue the certificate, then it creates the certificate and provides it in its response.  The certificate is assigned a URI, which the client can use to fetch updated versions of the certificate.</p>
<pre>
      Client                                                 Server

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.11">Note that while ACME is defined with enough flexibility to handle different types of identifiers in principle, the primary use case addressed by this document is the case where domain names are used as identifiers.  For example, all of the identifier validation challenges described in Section {identifier-validation-challenges} below address validation of domain names.  The use of ACME for other protocols will require further specification, in order to describe how these identifiers are encoded in the protocol, and what types of validation challenges the server might require.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">ACME is structured as a REST application with a few types of resources:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Registration resources, representing information about an account</li>
  <li>Authorization resources, representing an account&#8217;s authorization to act for an identifier</li>
  <li>Challenge resources, representing a challenge to prove control of an identifier</li>

</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">For the &#8220;new-X&#8221; resources above, the server MUST have exactly one resource for each function.  This resource may be addressed by multiple URIs, but all must provide equivalent functionality.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">In general, the intent is for authorization and certificate resources to contain only public information, so that CAs may publish these resources to document what certificates have been issued and how they were authorized.  Non-public information, such as contact information, is stored in registration resources.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.5">In order to accomplish ACME transactions, a client needs to have the server&#8217;s new-registration, new-authorization, and new-certificate URIs; the remaining URIs are provided to the client as a result of requests to these URIs.  To simplify configuration, ACME uses the &#8220;next&#8221; link relation to indicate URI to contact for the next step in processing: From registration to authorization, and from authorization to certificate issuance.  In this way, a client need only be configured with the registration URI.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.6">The &#8220;up&#8221; link relation is used with challenge resources to indicate the authorization resource to which a challenge belongs.  It is also used from certificate resources to indicate a resource from which the client may fetch a chain of CA certificates that could be used to validate the certificate in the original resource.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.7">The following diagram illustrates the relations between resources on an ACME server.  The solid lines indicate link relations, and the dotted lines correspond to relationships expressed in other ways, e.g., the Location header in a 201 (Created) response.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.9">All ACME requests with a non-empty body MUST encapsulate the body in a JWS object, signed using the account key pair.

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.1">The identifier authorization process establishes the authorization of an account to manage certificates for a given identifier.  This process must assure the server of two things: First, that the client controls the private key of the account key pair, and second, that the client holds the identifier in question.  This process may be repeated to associate multiple identifiers to a key pair (e.g., to request certificates with multiple identifiers), or to associate multiple accounts with an identifier (e.g., to allow multiple entities to manage certificates).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.2">As illustrated by the figure in the overview section above, the authorization process proceeds in two phases.  The client first requests a new authorization, and then the server issues challenges that the client responds to.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.3">To begin the key authorization process, the client sends a POST request to the server&#8217;s new-authorization resource.  The body of the POST request MUST contain a JWS object, whose payload is a partial authorization object.  This JWS object MUST contain only the &#8220;identifier&#8221; field, so that the server knows what identifier is being authorized.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.4">The authorization object is implicitly tied to the account key used to sign the request. Once created, the authorization may only be updated and referenced by that account.</p>

If the server is unwilling to issue for the identifier, it SHOULD return a 403 (Forbidden) error, with a problem document describing the reason for the rejection.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.9">The client needs to respond with information to complete the challenges.  To do this, the client updates the authorization object received from the server by filling in any required information in the elements of the &#8220;challenges&#8221; dictionary.  For example, if the client wishes to complete the &#8220;simpleHttp&#8221; challenge, it needs to provide the &#8220;path&#8221; component.  (This is also the stage where the client should perform any actions required by the challenge.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.10">The client sends these updates back to the server in the form of a JSON object with the response fields required by the challenge type, carried in a POST request to the challenge URI (not authorization URI or the new-authorization URI).  This allows the client to send information only for challenges it is responding to.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.11">For example, if the client were to respond to the &#8220;simpleHttp&#8221; challenge in the above authorization, it would send the following request:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.12">The server updates the authorization document by updating its representation of the challenge with the response fields provided by the client.  The server MUST ignore any fields in the response object that are not specified as response fields for this type of challenge.  The server provides a 202 (Accepted) response including the updated challenge.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.13">Presumably, the client&#8217;s responses provide the server with enough information to validate one or more challenges.  The server is said to &#8220;finalize&#8221; the authorization when it has completed all the validations it is going to complete, and assigns the authorization a status of &#8220;valid&#8221; or &#8220;invalid&#8221;, corresponding to whether it considers the account authorized for the identifier.  If the final state is &#8220;valid&#8221;, the server MUST add an &#8220;expires&#8221; field to the authorization.  When finalizing an authorization, the server MAY remove the &#8220;combinations&#8221; field (if present) or remove any unfulfilled challenges.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.14">Usually, the validation process will take some time, so the client will need to poll the authorization resource to see when it is finalized.  For challenges where the client can tell when the server has validated the challenge (e.g., by seeing an HTTP or DNS request from the server), the client SHOULD NOT begin polling until it has seen the validation request from the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.15">To check on the status of an authorization, the client sends a GET request to the authorization URI, and the server responds with the current  authorization object.  To provide some degree of control over polling, the server MAY provide a Retry-After header field to indicate how long it expect to take in finalizing the response.</p>

The client responds with another random value S.  The server initiates a TLS connection on port 443 to one or more of the IPv4 or IPv6 hosts with the domain name being validated.  In the handshake, the ACME server sets the Server Name Indication extension set to &#8220;&lt;nonce&gt;.acme.invalid&#8221;.  The TLS server (i.e., the ACME client) should respond with a valid self-signed certificate containing both the domain name being validated and the domain name &#8220;&lt;Z&gt;.acme.invalid&#8221;, where Z = SHA-256(R || S).</p>
